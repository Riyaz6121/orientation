Metric: True Hold Yield
Definition:
The True Hold Yield measures the real cashflow efficiency of a property once all ownership costs are factored in — not just rent versus purchase price.

It’s the net annual cash yield after interest, expenses, and expected capital growth are adjusted for holding period.
 Formula (simple version)
True Hold Yield = [ 
(Annual Rent – Annual Expenses – Annual Interest) + (Expected Annual Capital Growth × Holding Years ÷ 2)×100  ]
/ Property Value
 

 Why it matters for investors
•	Goes beyond Gross or Net Yield: Traditional yields ignore interest, maintenance, strata, insurance, and growth effects.
•	Helps compare across markets: Allows a Brisbane unit, Perth house, and Sydney townhouse to be compared on equal footing over a 5- or 10-year horizon.
•	Focuses on holding efficiency: Investors can quickly see which properties are worth holding longer vs flipping sooner.
•	Reveals over- or under-performance: If True Hold Yield < 2.5%, you’re effectively subsidising ownership (poor efficiency). If >5%, it’s a strong hold performer.



 Example (5-year horizon)
Metric	Amount
Property value	$650,000
Annual rent	$28,600
Annual expenses (rates, strata, insurance, etc.)	$6,000
Annual interest	$23,000
Expected capital growth	4% p.a.
True Hold Yield (5 yrs)	≈ 4.2%
(You’re effectively “earning” 4.2% per year on your capital after all real holding costs.)

How to use it
•	For investors: Benchmark your properties or shortlist by “True Hold Yield >4%” to identify efficient, cash-sustainable assets.
•	For advisors or buyer’s agents: Incorporate it into dashboards or pitch decks to demonstrate risk-adjusted return quality.
•	For analysts: Can be refined by layering suburb-level growth forecasts or different debt assumptions (e.g. 60% LVR vs 90%).
